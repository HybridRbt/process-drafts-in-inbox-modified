# process Drafts in INBOX modified
a customized version of the Drafts action by @FlohGro: https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1ch

Improvements over the original action:
1. User can now choose the workspace to apply this action to, instead of hard code it in the script. 
2. The origianl code will process ALL drafts in the workspace, including the ones that in archive and trash, which will create duplicates in some situation. This version will only process the drafts inside INBOX.
